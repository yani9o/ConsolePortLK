        Pixel Bridge
    </H1><br/>
    <p align="left">
        The |cFFFF6600Pixel Bridge|r is an experimental synchronization system designed to close the gap between the game client and WoWpadX.
        <br/><br/>
        By encoding your character's real-time state into tiny, unnoticeable pixels in the corner of your screen, ConsolePort can communicate useful information to WoWpadX without the need for intrusive memory reading.
    </p><br/>
    <H2 align="left">
        What does it enable?
    </H2>
    <p align="left">
        While ConsolePort handles the interface, the Pixel Bridge provides the external mapper with "eyes" inside the game world. This enables some QoL features in WoWpadX such as:
        <br/><br/>
        |cff69ccf0• Precise Haptic Feedback:|r Your controller can vibrate or change LED colors based on your actual health percentage.<br/>
        |cff69ccf0• Adaptive Movement:|r The system can automatically detect if your character is walking or running, adjusting stick sensitivity on the fly for smoother navigation.<br/>
        |cff69ccf0• Combat Awareness:|r External overlays or rumble effects can trigger the moment you enter combat or start targeting a spell reticle.<br/>
        |cff69ccf0• Intelligent Mouselook:|r Prevents "ghost" cursor movements by instantly syncing the camera toggle state between the game and your sticks.
    </p><br/>
    <H2 align="left">
        How to use it
    </H2>
    <p align="left">
        To activate the bridge, go to the <a href="run:ConsolePortOldConfig:OpenCategory('Config')">|cff69ccf0Settings|r</a> menu and check |cFFFF6600Enable Pixel Bridge|r.
        <br/><br/>
        Once enabled, you will notice a tiny (8x1 pixel) flickering magenta block in the top-left corner of your screen. This is the "Beacon" that your controller software uses to lock onto the game window. 
        <br/><br/>
        |cffff269bNote:|r For the bridge to work, the top-left corner of your game window must be visible and not obscured by other applications (like Discord overlays or web browsers).
    </p><br/>
    <H2 align="left">
        Performance and Safety
    </H2>
    <p align="left">
        The Pixel Bridge is entirely passive. It does not modify game files, read protected memory, or interact with the server in any way. It simply displays a few colored pixels, making it the safest way to achieve advanced haptic integration.
        <br/><br/>
        In terms of performance, the impact is effectively zero. It takes less processing power than showing a single icon on your action bar.
